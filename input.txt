Here we go, learning is a process, a marathon, not a sprint
Welcome Larry Muia, the CEO and CTO at Horizon Softwares
We are destined for great stuff ahead, but we really have to stay vigilant and engaged to the role.
Greatness is not granted.. but earned through effort and commitment.
Coding and programming are vital skills we all have to consider and embrace without delay.
Software Engineering, data science, data analytics, cloud computing, Devops, cyber security, networking, telecommunication and others..are some of the key skills we really have to consider intuitively!.
